# Election-analysis

## Project Overview 
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. They have requested to provide a complete audit to provide the election results.  

1.Calculate the total number of votes cast. 

2.Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 

3.Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 

4.Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 

5.Determine the winner of the election based on popular votes.

## Election-Audit Overview
Overall, the analysis was performed well. There were few challenges that I personally came across. It was mainly when I was trying to push my python file to the repository. I had to try multiple codes to push the file correctly. The second challenging part was the indentation in python. We have to be very careful when it comes to indentation. Wrong indentation can provide you with the incorrect results. 

## Election-Audit Summary
Overall the election-audit was intense. It did provide the full election summary that the board had required. This script can be used for other elections in 2 ways. Right now, this election audit was performed for one state. We can use the same script by each state instead of the using each city to perform the audit for all 50 states. The data set would be a lot bigger to analyze.
